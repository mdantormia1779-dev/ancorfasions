# Phase 14: Enterprise Testing, Quality Assurance, CI/CD, and Production Operations Platform

## 1. Testing Architecture

The Anchor Fashion E-commerce Platform adopts a rigorous, multi-layered testing strategy (the Testing Pyramid) to ensure high code quality, system reliability, and rapid feedback during development.

### 1.1 Unit Testing
- **Framework**: Vitest, React Testing Library.
- **Scope**: Individual components, utility functions, state management stores (Zustand), and data transformation logic.
- **Coverage Target**: >85% for business logic and UI components.
- **Execution**: Runs on every commit (pre-push) and every Pull Request.

### 1.2 Integration Testing
- **Framework**: Vitest with MSW (Mock Service Worker) / Supabase local testing.
- **Scope**: Component interactions, API route handlers, and database interactions (RLS, triggers).
- **Execution**: Runs on every Pull Request to ensure integrated parts function correctly.

### 1.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Framework**: Playwright.
- **Scope**: Critical user journeys (Login, Add to Cart, Checkout, Order Tracking).
- **Execution**: Runs on PRs to `main` and `develop`, and nightly against the staging environment.
- **Cross-browser**: Tests run across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

### 1.4 Performance & Load Testing
- **Framework**: k6 (Grafana).
- **Scope**: High-traffic API routes, checkout flow under stress, and database query performance under load.
- **Execution**: Nightly schedule and prior to major campaign launches (e.g., Black Friday).

### 1.5 Security & Accessibility
- **Frameworks**: CodeQL, OWASP ZAP (Security); Axe-core / Playwright A11y (Accessibility).
- **Scope**: Identify vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, CSRF) and WCAG compliance.
- **Execution**: Security scans run weekly and on PRs. A11y tests run in E2E.

## 2. QA Architecture & Defect Management

### 2.1 Environments
- **Local Development**: Developer machines (`localhost:3000`).
- **Preview Deployments**: Vercel auto-generated environments for every PR.
- **Staging**: `staging.anchorfashion.com` - Pre-production replica, used for final QA, UAT, and load testing.
- **Production**: `www.anchorfashion.com` - Live environment.

### 2.2 Bug Tracking Workflow
1. **Identification**: Automated alert or manual QA report.
2. **Logging**: GitHub Issues with labels (`bug`, `priority:high`, `severity:critical`).
3. **Triage**: Weekly QA sync to assign priority and severity.
4. **Resolution**: Developer fixes on `fix/*` branch, PR to `develop`.
5. **Verification**: QA verifies on Preview deployment.
6. **Closure**: Issue closed upon merge to `main` and production deployment.

### 2.3 Severity Levels
- **S1 (Critical)**: Site down, checkout broken, data loss. Fix immediately.
- **S2 (High)**: Major feature broken, no workaround. Fix in next sprint.
- **S3 (Medium)**: Non-critical feature broken, workaround exists.
- **S4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issue, minor typo.

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Strategy

The pipeline is entirely automated using GitHub Actions and Vercel.

### 3.1 Continuous Integration (CI)
Triggered on push to `develop` and `main`, and on Pull Requests.
- **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier.
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript `tsc --noEmit`.
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest execution.
- **Build Verification**: Next.js production build (`npm run build`).

### 3.2 Continuous Deployment (CD)
Triggered upon merge to specific branches.
- **Merge to `develop`**: Vercel deploys to Staging environment. Playwright E2E tests run against Staging.
- **Merge to `main`**: Vercel deploys to Production (Blue/Green). Supabase DB migrations applied automatically via GitHub Actions.

## 4. Deployment Strategy & Vercel Best Practices

### 4.1 Production Deployment (Vercel)
- **Edge Network**: Leverage Vercel Edge Network for caching static assets and global API routing.
- **Blue/Green Deployments**: Vercel provides atomic, immutable deployments. The new version is built, and if successful, traffic is instantly swapped.
- **Rollback Strategy**: Instant rollbacks via Vercel dashboard or CLI (`vercel rollback`). Database rollbacks require manual intervention using `supabase db down`.

### 4.2 Database Migration Strategy
- **Supabase CLI**: Migrations are version-controlled in `supabase/migrations`.
- **Execution**: Migrations run automatically via GitHub Action **after** successful Vercel build but **before** traffic swap.
- **Backward Compatibility**: All database migrations MUST be backward compatible to support zero-downtime deployments.

## 5. Release Management

### 5.1 Versioning Strategy
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.4`).
- **Release Automation**: Standard-version used for automated version bumping and `CHANGELOG.md` generation.

### 5.2 Release Process
1. **Feature Freeze**: Code freeze on `develop`.
2. **Release Branch**: Create `release/vX.Y.Z` from `develop`.
3. **UAT & Load Testing**: Perform final QA on the release branch (deployed to Staging).
4. **Merge to Main**: Merge release branch into `main`. Tag commit `vX.Y.Z`.
5. **Deploy**: CI/CD deploys to production.
6. **Backmerge**: Merge `main` back into `develop`.

## 6. Production Operations & Observability

### 6.1 Monitoring & Alerting
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Vercel Analytics / Sentry.
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry (Real-time alerting for unhandled exceptions).
- **Database Health**: Supabase Dashboard / pg_stat_statements.

### 6.2 Incident Management (SRE)
- **Detection**: Automated alerts via Slack/PagerDuty for 5xx errors or increased latency.
- **Response**: On-call engineer acknowledges within 15 minutes (S1).
- **Postmortem**: Blameless postmortem document required for all S1/S2 incidents within 48 hours, defining Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and action items.

## 7. Final Deployment Checklist

Before the initial production launch, the following must be validated:

- [ ] All Unit & E2E tests pass on `main`.
- [ ] k6 Load test validates handling of 500+ Concurrent Users (VUs) with p(95) latency < 500ms.
- [ ] Vercel Environment Variables verified in Production.
- [ ] Supabase Database Password rotated and updated in GitHub Secrets.
- [ ] Supabase Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) enabled.
- [ ] Custom Domain SSL provisioned on Vercel.
- [ ] Sentry / Analytics integrations active.

## 8. Enterprise Best Practices

- **Never test in production**: Utilize Preview and Staging environments.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Database schemas and GitHub workflows must remain in version control.
- **Shift-Left Security**: Code scanning happens on PR, not post-merge.
- **Zero-Downtime**: Deployments must not interrupt active user sessions.
